# NMU - Network Monitor Utility
This project is to help the author learn more about networks and monitors,
afterall what better way to learn than by doing? This project will for the
most part be written in C, although I do miss Rust's lifetimes to help me
understand libc and low level functionality on the side of the linux kernel
more as oppposed to having abstractions through Rust. Eventually, once the
packet decoding is setup I plan on developing statistics/heuristics to judge
network security and whether devices make sense to be on the network.
Hopefully this can translate to a hook that can do some operation for the
network.
